    <h1>Early Life of Jesus of Nazareth</h1>
    <p>Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Judea – then part of the Roman Empire, under the rule of Herod. Jesus was born into a Jewish family; his parents were Mary and Joseph of Nazareth. 
    Jesus was born in Bethlehem because his father had to travel to his place of birth to take part in the Roman census. 
    Because of over-crowding due to the census, the family were offered a place in a stable, and hence Jesus was born in the humblest of surroundings – in a manger surrounded by animals.</p>

        Many others were weeping at the sight of Jesus being taken to his execution. He had to carry a cross and at one stage fainted – and was helped by Simon of Cyrene.
        Jesus was nailed to the cross with an inscription above his head. 
        “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews” (INRI). He was crucified in between two thieves
